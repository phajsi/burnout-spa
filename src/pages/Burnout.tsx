          In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement originated in the US to provide
          free medical treatment to individuals with no health insurance, the
          Free Clinic Movement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These clinics were run by volunteers, a mix of nurses, doctors, and
          students, who worked after their regular workday ended. Due to the
          prevalence of drug-related issues during that time, the clinics often
          treated drug related illnesses, and at the time, the term "burnout"
          was used to describe the physical effects of chronic drug use.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A psychologist named Herbert Freudenberg, who worked in these clinics,
          observed that the workers were becoming depressed, apathetic, and
          agitated, leading to the popularization of the term{" "}
          <cite>burnout syndrome</cite> within the community of workers involved
          in the movement. Freudenberg later wrote several academic papers on
          this phenomenon.

          Only recently has the World Health Organisation, WHO, added burnout to
          itâ€™s characterisation system for illnesses, the ICD-11, in 2019. The
          WHO defines burnout as

          One cannot talk about burnout without mentioning Christina Maslach,
          the pioneer researcher who has devoted her life to researching
          occupational burnout since the 70â€™s. The basis of her work laid the
          foundation for the WHOâ€™s recognition of burnout as a workplace
          syndrome. Maslach defines burnout as
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-500 bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-base sm:text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">
              a psychological syndrome that involves a prolonged response to
              chronic situational stressors on the job
            </p>
          </blockquote>{" "}
          Her work led to the identification of the following three burnout
          dimensions:
        </p>

        <div className="w-fit m-auto my-8">
          <BurnoutDimensionsSVG />
        </div>

        <p>
          One important point that arises from the definitions of burnout is
          that it only manifests in the workplace setting, highlighting the role
          of employers and organizations as essential factors in its
          development. Burnout being the consequence of a malfunctioning system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Going through stressful periods at work, like working extra to meet a
          deadline, is unavoidable at times. However, burnout arises when this
          stress becomes a constant. It follows that to avoid burnout and help
          burnt out people, not only the individuals must be helped, but the
          workplace as well.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          To not only focus on the negative, it is interesting to note that job
          engagement, defined as
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-500 bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-base sm:text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">
              an energetic state of involvement with personally fulfilling
              activities that enhance one's sense of professional efficacy
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          is considered as being the opposite state of burnout. Having
          engagement as a desired outcome in the workplace in the back of our
          minds, helps us think about the factors in the workplace that we
          should strive for, and that gives us energy and enjoyment.

        Moreover, employee engagement doesn't just benefit the workers; it can
        drive business outcomes as well. Research has found significant
        correlations between engagement and how well organizations collect and
        utilize customer feedback, as well as the ability of teams to visualize
        and understand the development process from start to finish. Engagement
        is also linked to how much employees align with their workplace's values
        and goals, and how much effort they're willing to put in to ensure the
        organization's success.

        Maslach's research resulted in the identification of six key domains in
        worklife, as situational predictors of burnout. The key idea is that
        finding a good fit between the person and their job is essential. This
