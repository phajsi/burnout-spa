            In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement originated in the US to provide
            free medical treatment to individuals with no health insurance, the
            Free Clinic Movement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These clinics were run by volunteers, a mix of nurses, doctors, and
            students, who worked after their regular workday ended. Due to the
            prevalence of drug-related issues during that time, the clinics
            often treated drug related illnesses, and at the time, the term
            "burnout" was used to describe the physical effects of chronic drug
            use.

          A psychologist named Herbert Freudenberg, who worked in these clinics,
          observed that the workers were becoming depressed, apathetic, and
          agitated, leading to the popularization of the term{" "}
          <cite>burnout syndrome</cite> within the community of workers involved
          in the movement. Freudenberg later wrote several academic papers on
          this phenomenon.

          Only recently has the World Health Organisation, WHO, added burnout to

            <p className="text-base sm:text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">

          One cannot talk about burnout without mentioning Christina Maslach,
          the pioneer researcher who has devoted her life to researching
          occupational burnout since the 70â€™s. The basis of her work laid the
          foundation for the WHOâ€™s recognition of burnout as a workplace
          syndrome. Maslach defines burnout as
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-500 bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-base sm:text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">
              a psychological syndrome that involves a prolonged response to
              chronic situational stressors on the job
            </p>
          </blockquote>{" "}
          Her work led to the identification of the following three burnout
          dimensions:
        </p>

        <div className="w-fit m-auto my-8">
          <BurnoutDimensionsSVG />
        </div>

        <p>
          One important point that arises from the definitions of burnout is
          that it only manifests in the workplace setting, highlighting the role
          of employers and organizations as essential factors in its
          development. Burnout being the consequence of a malfunctioning system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Going through stressful periods at work, like working extra to meet a
          deadline, is unavoidable at times. However, burnout arises when this
          stress becomes a constant. It follows that to avoid burnout and help
          burnt out people, not only the individuals must be helped, but the
          workplace as well.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          To not only focus on the negative, it is interesting to note that job
          engagement, defined as
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-500 bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-base sm:text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-neutral-200">
              an energetic state of involvement with personally fulfilling
              activities that enhance one's sense of professional efficacy
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          is considered as being the opposite state of burnout. Having
          engagement as a desired outcome in the workplace in the back of our
          minds, helps us think about the factors in the workplace that we
          should strive for, and that gives us energy and enjoyment.

        Research into high performing organisations in software development has
        shown that employee engagement and satisfaction are indicative of
        employee loyalty and identity, they can help reduce the likelihood of
        burnout while driving key organizational outcomes such as profitability,
        productivity, and market share. In fact, employees in high-performing

        Moreover, employee engagement doesn't just benefit the workers; it can

        utilize customer feedback, as well as the ability of teams to visualize
        and understand the development process from start to finish. Engagement
        is also linked to how much employees align with their workplace's values

        organizations. The results of their research is compiled into the book

        According to the authors, Lean management practices have a strong
        positive influence on software delivery performance and team culture,
        while also reducing burnout and promoting a more generative culture.
        Practices such as{" "}
        <b>
          limiting Work In Process, implementing visual management, providing
          feedback from production, and implementing lightweight change approval
          processes{" "}
        </b>{" "}
        were found to contribute to these positive outcomes.

        The core principles of Lean management involve granting employees the
        necessary time and resources to improve their work and creating an
        environment that supports experimentation, failure and learning, and
        which allows employees to make decisions that impact their jobs.

        Organizational culture was found to predict software delivery
        performance and organizational performance. A power oriented culture,
        characterized by low cooperation, nontransparence and blaming have
        employees with strong feelings of burnout. Managers can counteract by
        creating a blame free environment, learn from failures and communicating
        shared sense of purpose, in that way transforming the culture into a
        generative one.

        Deployments
      </h3>
      <p className="mx-auto text-cyan-100 my-4 w-3/4 md:w-2/4 place-items-center">
        A high correlation was found between deployment pain, which contributes
        to feelings of stress and lack of control, and poor IT performance,
        organizational performance and organizational culture. Systems should be
        designed to be deployed easily, be able to detect and tolerate failure
        and have loosely coupled architectures, so that itâ€™s components can be
        updated easily. They should also be able to automatically reproduce the
        state of production systems from information in version control.

        A 2020 survey of more than 500 software developers in North America
        examining the state of Big Code, which refers to the dramatic growth in
        the volume and complexity of code, found that 88% of teams admitted that
        evry release caused some anxiety. When asked about the emotions that
        code releases make them feel, there was a 50/50 response of satisfaction
        vs fear or anxiety.
