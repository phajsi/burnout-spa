          In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement originated in the US to provide
          free medical treatment to individuals with no health insurance, the
          Free Clinic Movement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These clinics were run by volunteers, a mix of nurses, doctors, and
          students, who worked after their regular workday ended. Due to the
          prevalence of drug-related issues during that time, the clinics often
          treated drug related illnesses, and at the time, the term "burnout"
          was used to describe the physical effects of chronic drug use.

          A psychologist named Herbert Freudenberg, who worked in these clinics,
          observed that the workers were becoming depressed, apathetic, and
          agitated, leading to the popularization of the term{" "}
          <cite>burnout syndrome</cite> within the community of workers involved
          in the movement. Freudenberg later wrote several academic papers on
          this phenomenon.

          Only recently has the World Health Organisation, WHO, added burnout to
          itâ€™s characterisation system for illnesses, the ICD-11, in 2019. The
          WHO defines burnout as:
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-200">
              a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not
              been successfully managed
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          One cannot talk about burnout without mentioning Christina Maslach, a
          pioneer researcher who has devoted her life to researching
          occupational burnout since the 70â€™s. The basis of her work laid the
          foundation for the WHOâ€™s recognition of burnout as a workplace
          syndrome. Maslach defines burnout as:
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-200">
              a psychological syndrome that involves a prolonged response to
              chronic situational stressors on the job
            </p>
          </blockquote>{" "}
          Her work led to the identification of three burnout dimensions:{" "}
          <span className="bg-sky-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">
            Exhaustion
          </span>
          ,{" "}
          <span className="bg-red-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">Cynicism</span>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <span className="bg-amber-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">
            Inefficacy
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          An important aspect can be taken from these definitions: that burnout
          only occurs in the context of employment within an organisation. This
          is important because it highlights the role of employers and
          workplaces as necessary factors for burnout. Burnout being a
          consequence of a malfunctioning system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Going through stressful periods at work, like working extra to meet a
          deadline, is unavoidable at times. However, burnout arises when this
          stress becomes a constant. It follows that to avoid burnout and help
          burnt out people, not only the individuals must be helped, but the
          workplace as well.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          To not only focus on the negative, it is interesting to note that job
          engagement, defined as
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-200">
              an energetic state of involvement with personally fulfilling
              activities that enhance one's sense of professional efficacy
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          is considered as being the opposite state of burnout. Having
          engagement as a desired outcome in the workplace in the back of our
          minds, helps us think about the factors in the workplace that we
          should strive for, and that gives us energy and enjoyment.

        Many associate burnout with the feeling of being exhausted, not having
        the energy to accomplish basic tasks. But exhaustion is but one of the

          Exhaustion represents the individual dimension of burnout. It relates

          <div className="border-2 rounded-md p-2 my-2 border-sky-800 bg-[#397A9D]">

          The component of cynicism or depersonalisation represents the

        The exhaustion dimension of burnout, being the closest related to stress
        is also the one most predictive of stress-related health outcomes.
        Exhaustion has been found to correlate with stress symptoms like{" "}

        Burnout is linked to various adverse reactions to work, including job
        dissatisfaction, low commitment to the organization, absenteeism,
        intention to quit the job, and employee turnover. Those experiencing
        burnout can also have a negative impact on their colleagues by causing
        personal conflicts or disrupting job tasks. Poor job performance is one
        of the most significant consequences of burnout in the workplace, which
        could have severe consequences in certain professions, even leading to
        fatal outcomes.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="mx-auto text-cyan-100 my-4 w-3/4 lg:w-2/4 place-items-center">
        It is important to note that employee engagement, the opposite of
        burnout, is incredibly powerful and important for organisations
        thriving.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="mx-auto text-cyan-100 my-4 w-3/4 lg:w-2/4 place-items-center">
        Research into high performing organisations in software development has
        shown that employee engagement and satisfaction are indicative of
        employee loyalty and identity, they can help reduce the likelihood of
        burnout while driving key organizational outcomes such as profitability,
        productivity, and market share. In fact, employees in high-performing
        teams were twice as likely to recommend their organization to a friend
        as a great place to work.
      </p>
      <p className="mx-auto text-cyan-100 my-4 w-3/4 lg:w-2/4 place-items-center">
        Moreover, employee engagement doesn't just benefit the workers; it can
        drive business outcomes as well. Research has found significant
        correlations between engagement and how well organizations collect and
        utilize customer feedback, as well as the ability of teams to visualize
        and understand the development process from start to finish. Engagement
        is also linked to how much employees align with their workplace's values
        and goals, and how much effort they're willing to put in to ensure the
        organization's success.
