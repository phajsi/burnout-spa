          In the 1960s and 1970s, a movement originated in the US to provide
          free medical treatment to individuals with no health insurance, the
          Free Clinic Movement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These clinics were run by volunteers, a mix of nurses, doctors, and
          students, who worked after their regular workday ended. Due to the
          prevalence of drug-related issues during that time, the clinics often
          treated drug related illnesses, and at the time, the term "burnout"
          was used to describe the physical effects of chronic drug use.

          A psychologist named Herbert Freudenberg, who worked in these clinics,
          observed that the workers were becoming depressed, apathetic, and
          agitated, leading to the popularization of the term{" "}
          <cite>burnout syndrome</cite> within the community of workers involved
          in the movement. Freudenberg later wrote several academic papers on
          this phenomenon.

          Hi there! You might have come across this page because you personally
          experienced burnout, are uncertain if how youâ€™re feeling constitutes
          burnout or want to help someone that is suffering from burnout. You
          might even want to learn how to best prevent it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Iâ€™ll do my best to share what I have discovered in my research, and
          hopefully youâ€™ll understand burnout a little bit better ðŸ˜Š

          Only recently has the World Health Organisation, WHO, added burnout to
          itâ€™s characterisation system for illnesses, the ICD-11, in 2019. The
          WHO defines burnout as:
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-200">
              a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not
              been successfully managed
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          One cannot talk about burnout without mentioning Christina Maslach, a
          pioneer researcher who has devoted her life to researching
          occupational burnout since the 70â€™s. The basis of her work laid the
          foundation for the WHOâ€™s recognition of burnout as a workplace
          syndrome. Maslach defines burnout as:
          <blockquote className="p-4 my-4 border-l-4 border-gray-300 bg-gray-50 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-cyan-800">
            <p className="text-xl italic font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-200">
              a psychological syndrome that involves a prolonged response to
              chronic situational stressors on the job
            </p>
          </blockquote>{" "}
          Her work led to the identification of three burnout dimensions:{" "}
          <span className="bg-teal-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">
            Exhaustion
          </span>
          ,{" "}
          <span className="bg-red-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">Cynicism</span>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <span className="bg-amber-800 p-2 rounded-md leading-10">
            Inefficacy
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          An important aspect can be taken from these definitions: that burnout
          only occurs in the context of employment within an organisation. This
          is important because it highlight the role of employers and workplaces
          are necessary factors for burnout. Burnout is a consequence of a
          malfunctioning system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Going through stressful periods at work, like working extra to meet a
          deadline, is unavoidable at times. However, burnout arises when this
          stress becomes a constant. It follows that to avoid burnout and help
          burnt out people, not only the individuals must be helped, but the
          workplace as well.

        Many associate burnout with the feeling of being exhausted, not having
        the energy to accomplish basic tasks. But exhaustion is but one of the
        facets of burnout. Maslachâ€™s research uncovered three basic dimensions
        from the burnout experience.{" "}

      <div className="flex my-12 items-center">
        <div className="w-fit mr-8">

            Exhaustion
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Exhaustion represents the individual dimension of burnout. It relates
          to the feeling of being stressed at work, and of being overextended
          and depleted of emotional, mental and physical resources.
          <div className="border-2 rounded-md p-2 my-2 border-teal-800 bg-[#417E7A]">
            Typical signs of exhaustion are not being able to think straight,
            feeling fed up with work and just wanting to go home.

            Cynicism
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          The component of cynicism or depersonalisation represents the
          interpersonal dimension of burnout. It involves detachment from
          various aspects of the job, often resulting in a negative or apathetic
          attitude.{" "}
          <div className="border-2 rounded-md p-2 my-2 border-red-800 bg-[#AD4949]">
            Typical feelings of cynicism are negativity or hostility towards the
            work and coworkers, only doing the bare minimum. Not seeing the
            value in the work anymore.

        <p>
          The inefficacy component of burnout represents the self-evaluation
          dimension. It refers to feelings of incompetence and a lack of
          achievement and productivity in oneâ€™s work. It can also exacerbate
          feelings of Imposter Syndrome.
          <div className="border-2 rounded-md p-2 my-2 border-amber-800 bg-[#A8663E]">
            Typical feelings of inefficacy are feeling that there's no future,
